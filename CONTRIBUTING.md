# Contribution guidelines

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Github is used for everything

Github is used to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed something, update the documentation.
3. Make sure your code lints (using `scripts/lint`).
4. Test you contribution.
5. Issue that pull request!

## The CLA agreement must be completed (via [cla-assistant.io](cla-assistant.io))
This is a bit of an irritating step, but in order to make sure I can keep the free version hosted and running (since the AWS bill exceeds $1k/ month), I need to make sure I can still find ways to pay for it. Agreeing to the helps with that, since it allows other licenses to be used when needed. Please contact me <mail@pirateweather.net> if you have any questions or concerns with this, since I know it can be a pain point.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Pirate-Weather/pirate-weather-code/issues)

GitHub issues are used to track public bugs.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Pirate-Weather/pirate-weather-code/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Use [Ruff formater](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) to make sure the code follows the style.
